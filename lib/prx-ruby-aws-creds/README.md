Meant to be used in CLI Ruby scripts. Assumes it can do things with STDIN, like get user input, so generally would be useless in other scenarios.

## Usage

Add the Gem to a Ruby script that needs to make AWS API calls

```ruby
require "bundler/inline"

gemfile do
  gem "prx-ruby-aws-creds"
end
```

Use `RubyAwsCreds.client_credentials` when creating AWS SDK clients:

```ruby
client = Aws::SSM::Client.new(region: "us-east-1", credentials: RubyAwsCreds.client_credentials)
```

## Other

It's assumed that `OPTS[:profile]` will be set to a valid [config file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) profile name when `client_credentials` is called`.

Currently supports:
- Custom config file locations via `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`
- Profiles with a static key and secret and MFA token (`mfa_serial`). User will be prompted for TOTP code.
- Profiles configures to use SSO via [Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) (`sso_role_name`).

The temporary IAM credentials that are generated by this gem are stored in `#{Dir.home}/.aws/ruby/cache`.
